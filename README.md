Repository for a college project with 2 codes i developed.
This project was created using a Heltec ESP32 LoRa with a DHT22 sensor to get air humidity and temperature data and send to another node (another ESP32 LoRa device) through radiofrequency signal (point-to-point communication, so we have 2 codes, one for the sender and one for the receiver). After that, the data is displayed with few dashboards at Tago.io, the IoT platform.
You can make your changes, so don't forget to insert your WiFi and Tago.io credentials correctly. The frequency of LoRa radios also may be different in case you are not in Brazil (wich is 915 MHz), so check your region's available frequency (433 MHz, etc.)
Feel free to ontact me in case of any doubt you have.
Thank you!
